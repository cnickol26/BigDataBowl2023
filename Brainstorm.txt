We need to remove plays where the TE/WR/RB help the linesmen. Also, we are only at pass rush and also only looking at tackles. (chipping)
For chipping:
    We have to determine if a player chips 

Standardize for the ball

Remove scrambles

If the QB leaves certain zone (pocket), we discard that play because you can't grade a tackle for the QB running into a sack

QB can do 3, 5, 7 step drop back:
    Use the back step of their drop back

Can check if the tackle width/depth is the same to see if it is symmetric on the right and left side

We also need to include average time to throw for the QB

Remove data once the ball is thrown - only tracking data we care about is before ball is thrown

Treat right and left tackle as seperarated, isolated

Can also flip the right or left tackle so that the trace is the same

Include the skill of the defender rushing against you (Aaron Donald vs others)

Could punish for "chipping" where the tackle was given help.

Power vs. speed rushing (also speed to power moves)
  If there is any engaging at all or orientation to the linesman then it is power

For Power rushing:
    Calculate average QB depth from stepback and find average distance for tackle to defend - how long are you holding the defender for (seconds to give up the full distance to the QB)
    Time measure is better than distance measure
    
For Speed rushing:
    Calculate how good a guy is at his get off - how fast can he get depth, how fast can he get out to protect the speed rush area around. Get-off - how fast can you get your 2 yard depth
