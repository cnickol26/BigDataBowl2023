We need to remove plays where the TE/WR/RB help the linesmen. Also, we are only at pass rush and also only looking at tackles. (chipping)
For chipping:
    We have to determine if a player chips 

Standardize for the ball

Remove scrambles

If the QB leaves certain zone (pocket), we discard that play because you can't grade a tackle for the QB running into a sack

QB can do 3, 5, 7 step drop back:
    Use the back step of their drop back

Can check if the tackle width/depth is the same to see if it is symmetric on the right and left side

We also need to include average time to throw for the QB

Remove data once the ball is thrown - only tracking data we care about is before ball is thrown

Treat right and left tackle as seperarated, isolated

Can also flip the right or left tackle so that the trace is the same

Include the skill of the defender rushing against you (Aaron Donald vs others)

Could punish for "chipping" where the tackle was given help.

Power vs. speed rushing (also speed to power moves)
  If there is any engaging at all or orientation to the linesman then it is power

For Power rushing:
    Calculate average QB depth from stepback and find average distance for tackle to defend - how long are you holding the defender for (seconds to give up the full distance to the QB)
    Time measure is better than distance measure
    
For Speed rushing:
    Calculate how good a guy is at his get off - how fast can he get depth, how fast can he get out to protect the speed rush area around. Get-off - how fast can you get your 2 yard depth
    
Modeling thoughts:

Once we have it broken down to speed and power we need to decide how we want to measure performance
    -Power rushing: Predicted time to get to the quarterback vs actual time?
    -Speed rushing: Get off time/ time to get to a certain depth?
        -Harder to evaluate since a win may involve pushing the end back around behind the quarterback
    - Pooling or Bayesian Hierarchial to deal with the different groups we have in the data
        -Maybe trying to predict some sort of latent variable
    - Want rankings and not clusters of similar players which makes unsupervised harder
    
Connor's thoughts after talking with Porter:
    -Think your idea Josh about just looking at direction to seperate into speed and power is good
    -Could look for each time how many rows there are where the OT is within a certain distance to a DE and facing them (Binary encode and then sum with some threshold)
    -May be harder to classify speed since it's not just one or the other
        - Speed to power could be a problem
        - Could look and see if their direction at the start is straight up the field for a certain amount of yards
    -Once we have the split, Bayesian Hierarchial seems to be a good direction
        -Will be impressive to talk about in our report, which seems to be important looking at past winners
        -Priors on teams/players
            -Looking at heights and weights is proabably a good place to start
                -Has an impact on how long you can hold off a defender and most likely how fast you can get off the line
        -For power our response can be expected distance to the qb given up and compare that to actual
            -Will probably want to cut out throws under a certain amount of time
                -But can also have time to throw a variable in the model
                -Can include a variable if it is an obvious passing situation as well
        -For speed the response is harder but maybe we do expected get off time vs actual
            -Could include factors such as quarter here
                -Maybe get off time increases (slows) as the game goes on
        -Once we have both we want to aggregate in some way
            - I like the idea of using the percentages we see each rush as our weights and then ranking
            - Will want to say the way we have it set up is more of a gauge at how skilled a tackle is or their athletic ability since for speed we're not necessarily looking at if they gave up a sack, more if they were in the position or not to stop the DE
